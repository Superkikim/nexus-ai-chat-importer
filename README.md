**Requirements:**

1. The conversation must still exist in your account history
1. You need to be authenticated in your browser
1. You may require an active subscription to access your chat history

## üöÄ Critical Performance Fix in v1.0.8

**If you‚Äôre experiencing slow Obsidian startup after importing many conversations, this update is essential:**

- **Problem Fixed**: Previous versions caused Obsidian to become extremely slow when you had imported 1000+ conversations
- **Root Cause**: The plugin was scanning all files every time you switched between notes
- **Solution**: Version 1.0.8 completely eliminates this file scanning, making Obsidian fast again
- **Impact**: Users report going from 30+ second startup times back to normal 2-3 second startups

**Recommended Action**: Update to v1.0.8 immediately if you have a large collection of imported conversations.

## Performance Improvements

Version 1.0.8 introduces significant performance optimizations:

- **Faster Startup**: Plugin loads much quicker, especially in large vaults
- **Smoother Navigation**: No more lag when switching between files
- **Better Memory Usage**: Plugin uses memory more efficiently during long sessions
- **Large Collection Support**: Handles 1000+ conversations without slowdowns

## Troubleshooting

- If the import fails, check the console log for error messages
- Ensure you have write permissions for your Obsidian vault
- Verify that the ZIP file is a valid ChatGPT export
- When importing multiple files, ensure they have valid timestamps in their filenames for proper ordering
- For performance issues with large vaults, try restarting Obsidian after installation

## Important Notes

### Performance Considerations

- The plugin works great even with thousands of imported conversations
- You may notice faster performance after restarting Obsidian following an upgrade
- Large imports work best when Obsidian isn‚Äôt busy with other tasks

### Upgrading from Previous Versions

- **CRITICAL**: If you have 1000+ conversations and slow Obsidian performance, update to v1.0.8 immediately
- Version 1.0.2+ users can upgrade seamlessly with massive performance improvements
- Users with versions prior to 1.0.2 should re-import conversations for full functionality
- Restart Obsidian after upgrading to experience the full performance benefits

After each import, a report is generated in `Reports/chatgpt/` showing:

- Number of conversations created/updated
- Attachment statistics (‚úÖ found, ‚ö†Ô∏è partial, ‚ùå missing)
- Links to imported conversations
- **Missing files**: Some older conversations don‚Äôt include all attachments in exports

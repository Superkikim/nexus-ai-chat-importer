    └── claude/
        └── import-20240115-150000.md
```

### Conversation Files

Each conversation is saved as a Markdown file with:

- **Frontmatter**: Rich metadata (ID, provider, dates, message count, aliases) that enables Obsidian's powerful features:
  - Search and filter by any metadata field
  - Create dynamic queries with Dataview plugin
  - Build custom dashboards and views
  - Track conversation history and statistics
- **Header**: Title with link to original web conversation
- **Messages**: Formatted with custom callouts (user, assistant, attachments, artifacts)
- **Timestamps**: ISO 8601 format for international compatibility

### Import Reports

Reports include:
- Summary statistics (total analyzed, imported, skipped)
- Per-file breakdown with detailed metrics
- Attachment statistics (found, missing, failed)
- Processing time and performance data
- Links to imported conversations

## 🎨 Visual Features

### Custom Callouts

The plugin uses Obsidian's callout system for beautiful formatting:

- 👤 **User messages**: Blue callouts with user icon
- 🤖 **Assistant messages**: Green callouts with bot icon
- 📎 **Attachments**: Amber callouts with paperclip icon
- ✨ **Artifacts** (Claude): Purple callouts with sparkles icon
- 🪄 **DALL-E Prompts**: Red callouts with magic wand icon

### Viewing Modes

- **Reading View**: Full visual experience with colored callouts
- **Live Preview**: Rendered callouts while editing
- **Source Mode**: Raw Markdown with callout syntax visible

**Recommendation**: Use Reading View for browsing conversations, Edit Mode for editing.

## 🔄 Selective Import

### How It Works

1. **Analysis Phase**: Plugin scans all ZIP files and extracts conversation metadata
2. **Selection Dialog**: Interactive table shows all available conversations with:
   - Title, date, message count
   - Status: 🆕 New, 🔄 Update, ✅ Already imported
   - Attachment information
   - Source file
3. **Deduplication**: Automatically detects duplicates across multiple files
4. **Import Phase**: Only selected conversations are processed

### Selection Features

- **Sort by**: Date, title, messages, or status
- **Filter by status**: Show only new, updates, or all conversations
- **Batch operations**: Select all, deselect all, or toggle individual items
- **Preview**: See conversation details before importing

## 📎 Attachment Handling

### What Gets Imported

The plugin automatically extracts and imports attachments from your conversation exports:

**ChatGPT Attachments**:
- 📷 **Images**: User-uploaded photos, screenshots
- 🎨 **DALL-E Images**: AI-generated images embedded with their original prompts
- 📄 **Documents**: PDFs, text files, code files
- 🔗 **Links**: Embedded as Obsidian links to the actual files

**Claude Attachments**:
- 📷 **Images**: User-uploaded images
- 📄 **Documents**: Uploaded files
- ✨ **Artifacts**: Code, documents, and other AI-generated content saved as separate versioned files (each modification creates a new version)

### Attachment Status

In your conversation notes, attachments show their status:

- ✅ **Found**: File successfully imported
- ⚠️ **Missing**: Referenced but not in ZIP export
- ❌ **Failed**: Import error occurred

### Storage Locations

```
Attachments/
├── chatgpt/
│   ├── images/
│   │   ├── dalle-abc123.png
│   │   └── photo-xyz789.jpg
│   └── documents/
│       └── report.pdf
└── claude/
    ├── artifacts/
    │   └── conversation-id/
    │       ├── script_v1.py
    │       ├── script_v2.py
    │       └── document_v1.md
    └── attachments/
        └── uploaded-file.pdf
```

### Missing Attachments

Some attachments may be missing from exports:

- **Older exports**: May not include all referenced files
- **Large files**: Sometimes excluded from ZIP
- **External links**: Not downloadable

**Settings**:
- Enable "Skip Missing Attachments" to continue import despite missing files
- Check import reports for detailed attachment statistics

## 📊 Import Reports

### What's in a Report

After each import, a detailed report is generated with:

**Summary Section**:
- Total conversations analyzed
- Total conversations imported
- Processing time
- Overall success rate

**Files Analyzed Table**:
```markdown
| File | Date | Conversations | Imported | Status |
|------|------|---------------|----------|--------|
| export-2024-01.zip | 2024-01-15 | 150 | 75 (50%) | ✅ |
| export-2024-02.zip | 2024-02-20 | 100 | 50 (50%) | ✅ |
```

**Per-File Statistics**:
For each ZIP file processed:
- Conversations analyzed vs. imported
- Status breakdown (🆕 new, 🔄 updates, ✅ existing)
- Attachment statistics (found/missing/failed)
- Processing details

**Attachment Details**:
- Total attachments found
- Missing attachments (with reasons)
- Failed imports (with error messages)
- DALL-E images with prompts

### Report Location

Reports are saved in:
```
Reports/
├── chatgpt/
│   └── import-20240115-143022.md
└── claude/
    └── import-20240115-150000.md
```

**Filename Format**: `import-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`

### Understanding Report Statistics

**When importing multiple files**:
- Each file is analyzed separately
- Duplicates across files are detected
- Only unique conversations are imported
- Report shows both analyzed and imported counts

**Example**:
```
File 1: 100 conversations analyzed, 50 imported (50 were duplicates)
File 2: 100 conversations analyzed, 30 imported (70 were duplicates or already existed)
Total: 200 analyzed, 80 imported
```

### Selective Import Reports

When using selective import:
- Report shows which conversations you selected
- Unselected conversations are marked as "skipped by user"
- Statistics reflect your selection choices

## 🔄 Reimporting & Updates

### Safe Reimporting

You can safely reimport the same ZIP file multiple times:
- ✅ **New conversations** are added
- ✅ **Updated conversations** are refreshed
- ✅ **Unchanged conversations** are skipped
- ✅ **No duplicates** are created

### When to Reimport

- **New conversations**: You've had more chats since your last export
- **Plugin updates**: New version adds features to conversation formatting
- **Fix issues**: Resolve any import problems from previous attempts
- **Attachment recovery**: Retry failed attachment downloads

### What Gets Updated

- Conversation content and messages
- Attachments and artifacts
- Frontmatter metadata
- Formatting and callouts

### What's Preserved

- Your manual edits to conversations (as long as frontmatter and message IDs remain intact)
- Existing attachments and artifacts
- Folder organization

> **⚠️ Important**: Avoid modifying frontmatter fields or deleting message IDs (hidden in Reading View). These are essential for proper reimport and update detection.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Provider-Specific Limitations

**Projects (ChatGPT & Claude)**:
- Project organization is not currently supported in this release
- All conversations are imported individually
- Future versions may add project support

**Attachments**:
- Only attachments included in the ZIP export can be imported
- Some older exports may not contain all referenced files
- DALL-E images are automatically detected and imported with their prompts

### Performance Considerations

**Large Archives**:
- Archives with 1000+ conversations may take several minutes to analyze
- Conversation selection dialog loads conversation titles for preview (not full content)
- Import progress is shown in real-time
- Obsidian may become temporarily unresponsive during indexing

**Multi-File Processing**:
- Processing multiple ZIP files adds deduplication overhead
- Each file is analyzed before the selection dialog appears
- Progress dialogs show current file and overall status

### Storage Considerations

**Vault Size**:
- Importing attachments significantly increases vault size
- AI-generated images can be several MB each
- Consider excluding the attachments folder from cloud sync

**Sync Performance**:
- Large attachment folders can slow down cloud sync
- Recommended: Add your attachments folder to your sync ignore list (folder path can be customized in settings)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Import Issues

**Import Stuck or Slow**:
- Check the progress dialog for current status
- Large archives with many attachments take longer
- Wait for the process to complete (can take 5-10 minutes for large archives)
- If truly frozen, restart Obsidian and try again

**No Conversations Appear in Selection Dialog**:
- Verify you selected the correct provider (ChatGPT vs Claude)
- Check that the ZIP file is a valid export from the provider
- Check the import report for detailed error information

**Missing Attachments**:
- Verify "Import Attachments" is enabled in settings
- Check that your export ZIP includes the attachments folder
- Some older exports may not contain all referenced files
- Check the import report for attachment statistics

### Formatting Issues

**Callouts Not Displaying Correctly**:
- Use **Reading View** for the best experience
- Ensure your Obsidian theme supports callouts
- Update to the latest version of Obsidian
- Try a different theme if issues persist

**Broken Links to Attachments**:
- Verify attachments were imported successfully
- Check the import report for attachment statistics
- Ensure attachment folder path hasn't changed
- Try reimporting with attachments enabled

### Settings & Migration Issues

**Settings Not Saving**:
- Check that you have write permissions to your vault
- Restart Obsidian after changing settings
- Verify the plugin is enabled

**Folder Migration Problems**:
- Don't manually move folders while the plugin is running
- Use the plugin's folder migration feature when changing paths
- Backup your vault before major folder reorganizations

### Getting Help

# Release Notes for Nexus AI Chat Importer

## Version 1.2.0 - Advanced Claude Artifact Versioning (In Development)

### üéØ Major Features

#### **Complete Claude Artifact Versioning System**
- **Individual version files**: Each artifact version now gets its own file (e.g., `script_v1.md`, `script_v2.md`)
- **Proper command handling**:
  - `create`: Initial version with complete content
  - `rewrite`: New complete version (resets content)
  - `update`: Applies sed-like replacements (`old_str` ‚Üí `new_str`) to previous version
- **Cumulative content tracking**: Updates build upon previous versions correctly
- **Chronological processing**: Artifacts processed in conversation order for accurate versioning

#### **Smart Conversation-Level Processing**
- **Architecture rewrite**: Moved from message-by-message to conversation-level artifact processing
- **Persistent content tracking**: Artifact content properly accumulates across entire conversation
- **Version-specific links**: Each artifact reference links to its specific version (not "latest")

#### **Enhanced Link System**
- **Specific version links**: `Artifact: script_name v2` instead of generic "Latest Version"
- **Note callouts**: Using `>[!note]` format for better Obsidian integration
- **Proper path handling**: Correct vault-relative paths for all artifact links

### üîß Technical Improvements

#### **Robust Update Handling**
- **Empty update filtering**: Skips UI-only updates with no content changes
- **Replacement logic**: Proper `old_str`/`new_str` replacement for incremental updates
- **Content validation**: Ensures all versions have meaningful content differences

#### **Reimport Compatibility**
- **Version UUID tracking**: Prevents duplicate versions on conversation updates
- **Incremental updates**: New artifact versions added without affecting existing ones
- **Consistent numbering**: Version numbers remain stable across reimports

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Fixed attachment links**: External Claude conversation links now properly clickable
- **Corrected div rendering**: Obsidian reading mode compatibility for attachment boxes
- **Resolved version conflicts**: Eliminated "File already exists" errors during processing

### üìã Breaking Changes
- **Artifact structure**: New versioned file structure may require reimporting existing Claude conversations
- **Link format**: Artifact links now point to specific versions rather than generic references
